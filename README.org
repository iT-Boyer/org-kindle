* Motivation

Because I store ebooks in Org Wiki style database. All ebooks are organized (use
=org-attach=) with links in Org-mode files under some kind of knowledge category
structure directories. So I need to send an ebook to external device with one
keybinding or one command instead of manually copy with complex path (=org-attach=
use some kind of prefix for storing directory).


* External Dependencies

This packages use a command =ebook-convert= which comes from [[https://calibre-ebook.com/][Calibre]]. So if you
want to use auto convert functionality, you need to install it manuall.


* Features

- auto send the file under org-mode ~file://~ link to your external devices like
  Kindle, NOOK etc with corresponding formats.
  - auto convert to corresponding formats if necessary. Like send =.epub= to
    Kindle by auto converting to =.mobi= or =.azw3= formats depending on your option
    ~org-send-ebook-kindle-default-format~.

* Todos

- [ ] One command =org-kindle-sync-notes= to sync Kindle's notes with Org Mode notes file.

* Notices

In theatrically, this package should work for non-kindle ereaders too. User can
set device path in variables. But becaused not tested, so I can't guarantee that
package will work correctly. But PR welcome to improve it. I appreciate it.
